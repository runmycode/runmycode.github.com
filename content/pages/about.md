Computational methods are an intrinsic part of modern science, and the
scientific publishing infrastructure has not kept pace with modern methods.
Journals provide archiving for supporting materials documents that textually
describe the methods used for articles, but do not provide support for
archiving materials used in modern research. As a result the audience of the
research must rely on the technical savvy of the authors. Authors roll their
own solutions to archive computational methods and results. Since there are no
good conventions to follow, these materials are packaged in unusable and
idiosyncratic ways. The current standard practices, which follow from the lack
of a publishing infrastructure, do not make it a reasonable expectation that
these materials should be provided. As a result the audience of the research
must also rely on the cultural savvy of the authors. This state of affairs has
contributed to the ongoing credibility gap in science.
[RunMyCode](http://www.runmycode.org/) is a modern platform that works with
authors and journals to provide an infrastructure to help bridge this gap.
